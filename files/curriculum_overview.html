                  <h4>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
                    themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
                    important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
                    process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
                    manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
                    successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
                    or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
                    strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and

                            <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
                              students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
                              group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
                              informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
                              and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
                              Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
                              curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
                              child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
                              read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p>
