      <h4>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.
      </h4>
      <h1></h1>
      <h4>
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.

      <h4>The	staff	at	the	nursery	school	respects	and	appreciates	the	talents	and	personalities	of each	
        child	and	their	family.	A	teacher’s	individual	talents	are	also	encouraged	as	they	
        develop their	own	personal	approach	in	the	classroom.	This	makes	for	a	vibrant,

    <h4>
      At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	children	are	unique	individuals	
      with	their	own	patterns	and	timetables	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
      development.		We	support	and	encourage	their	development	through	our	child-centered,	
      process-oriented,	play-based	curriculum	built	on	Constructivist	theories	and	practices.		
      Guided	by	the	teachings	of	educational	theorists	including	Piaget,	Dewey,	Vygotsky,	DeVries,	
      and	others,	we	create	a	learning	environment	that	addresses	the	developmental	needs	of	the

  <h2><b>CLASSROOM INFORMATION</b></h2>
  <h4>Our	classes focus	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Each	year’s	class	builds	
    on	the	previous	year’s	program	in	curriculum	experiences	and	activities	offered.	The	
    classrooms	are	set	up	to	invite	exploration	and	foster	a	lifelong	love	of	learning.	Our	staff	is	
    deeply	committed	to	the	young	child	and	the	importance	of	early	childhood	education.</h4>
    <div class = "phlist">

    <h4>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Two’s/Young Three’s:</u> Children	must	turn	3 by	February	1	of	that	school	year.	The	focus	of	
      this	class	is	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Separating	from	parents,	
      learning	to	take	direction,	and	being	nurtured	by	people	outside	of	immediate	family	are	
      important	milestones	for this	age.	The	building	of	trust	and	growing	peer	awareness	are	
      enhanced	by	a	safe	environment	that	provides	a	foundation	for	learning.	</li>
      <li><u>Three’s/Young Four’s:</u> The	emphasis	in	this class	is	to	encourage	further	socialization	by	
        reinforcing	how	a	child’s	choices	affect	their	relationships	and	environment.	There	are	
        greater	expectations	for	participation	and	appropriate	play	practices.	This	class	fosters	
        independence,	creativity,	cognitive	growth,	and	motor	coordination.	Children	are	introduced	
        to	phonemic	awareness,	patterning,	number	sequencing	with	value	recognition	and	
        following	both	verbal	and	visual	directions.	</li>
      <li><u>Four’s/Young Five’s:</u>	The	intent	of	this	class	is	to	further	support	the	development	of	social	
        awareness,	emotional	intelligence,	and	Kindergarten	readiness	skills.	Critical	thinking,	
        science,	sequencing,	sorting	and	classification,	matching,	number	values,	phonemic	
        awareness,	problem	solving,	storytelling	and	following	multi-step	directions	are	all	
        incorporated	in	our	curriculum.	Children	develop	their	gross	and	fine	motor	skills	while	
        working	in	large	and	small	groups.	Through	play	and	collaborative	group	work,	children
        come	to	appreciate	the	value	of	cooperation	and	contribution.	The	children	are	encouraged	
        to	take	risks,	helping	them	discover	how	the	process	of	learning	is	often	more	valuable	than	
        the	outcome.	Mastering	appropriate	academic	skills	and	fostering	social	emotional	growth	
        are	the	cornerstones	of	this	program.</li>
