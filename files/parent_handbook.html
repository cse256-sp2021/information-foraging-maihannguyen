      <h4>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.
      </h4>
      <h1></h1>
      <h4>
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.

  <h4>Our	classes focus	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Each	year’s	class	builds	
    on	the	previous	year’s	program	in	curriculum	experiences	and	activities	offered.	The	
    classrooms	are	set	up	to	invite	exploration	and	foster	a	lifelong	love	of	learning.	Our	staff	is

  <ul>
    <li><h3>Two’s/Young Three’s</h3></li>
      <h4>Children	must	turn	3 by	February	1	of	that	school	year.	The	focus	of	
      this	class	is	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Separating	from	parents,	
      learning	to	take	direction,	and	being	nurtured	by	people	outside	of	immediate	family	are	
      important	milestones	for this	age.	The	building	of	trust	and	growing	peer	awareness	are

        reinforcing	how	a	child’s	choices	affect	their	relationships	and	environment.	There	are	
        greater	expectations	for	participation	and	appropriate	play	practices.	This	class	fosters	
        independence,	creativity,	cognitive	growth,	and	motor	coordination.	Children	are	introduced	
        to	phonemic	awareness,	patterning,	number	sequencing	with	value	recognition	and	
        following	both	verbal	and	visual	directions.	</h4>

        <h4>The	intent	of	this	class	is	to	further	support	the	development	of	social

        science,	sequencing,	sorting	and	classification,	matching,	number	values,	phonemic	
        awareness,	problem	solving,	storytelling	and	following	multi-step	directions	are	all

        come	to	appreciate	the	value	of	cooperation	and	contribution.	The	children	are	encouraged	
        to	take	risks,	helping	them	discover	how	the	process	of	learning	is	often	more	valuable	than	
        the	outcome.	Mastering	appropriate	academic	skills	and	fostering	social	emotional	growth

  children	in	hands-on	learning	in	a	specialized content	area,	such	as	art,	science,	movement	or	
  literacy.	Bear	Trackers,	for	example,	might	take	a	nature hike	one	day,	create	an	art	project	
  the	next, or	dramatize	a	story in	any	particular week.</h4>

<h2><b>HOME AND SCHOOL COMMUNICATION</b></h2>
<h3>Orientation	Day</h3>
<h4>
This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
hour. It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.
</h4>
<h4>The	next day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
  orientation	schedule). The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
  Thursday. This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
  before the entire	class	attends	on Friday.</h4>
  <p></p>
<h3>Parent-Staff	Communication</h3>
<h4>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
  give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
  emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
  concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email

<h3>Assessment	and	Parent-Teacher	Conferences</h3>
<h4>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
  conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
  development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
  writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
  in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	</h4>
<h4>The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
  informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
  more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any

<h2><b>DISCIPLINE</b></h2>
<h4>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
  for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
  to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
  rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
  safe.</h4>
  <p></p>
  <h4>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
    appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
    stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
    the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
    their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
    more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
    lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.</h4>
    <h4>Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
      children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
      learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done

      part	of	the	daily	schedule.		During	the	winter	months	our	general	guideline	for	outdoor	play	
      is	that	we	will	usually	go	outside	when	it	is	above	20	degrees,	with	wind	chill	taken	into

        <h3>Allergies</h3>
      <h4>If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
        and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
        classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
        classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
        of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
        nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
        administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
        classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
        emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
        field	trips.</h4>

          form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
          will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign

        <h3>Health	Policy</h3>
        <h4>The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
          We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
          handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/

          cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
          adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.	If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
          cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.</h4>
